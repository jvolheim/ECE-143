## Data Processing

### Description

    The preprocessing file takes an input directory path to the Raw data directory which contains
    the data for each match played and an output path to store the processed data in. This can be 
    seen in the Results.csv file.

    Some manual processing via google and excel is required to check for cities and/or stadiums 
    that were renamed. The results of this processing can be seen in the results_post_step.csv file
